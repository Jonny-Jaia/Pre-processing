# Pre-processing Repository consists of
Code and Data files for the explanation of following topics:

## How to unzip input files from a zip file
  1. Installation of Package: pyunpack
  2. Example of unzipping the zip file using pyunpack
  Refer this Notebook: Unzip_example.ipynb and Input file: DemoImage.zip

## Image-Processing
### 1. Image tilt or rotation by x angle 
- Using different techniques. For the explaination:
  1. https://limitlessdatascience.wordpress.com/2019/04/05/image-rotation/
  
  (For the code Refer:"Tilt_or_rotate_an_image.ipynb" and DemoImage.png)
  
### 2. End to End automatic image tilt angle detection
- Exploration of Canny Edges and Hough linies detection
- demonstrated automatic tilt angle detection in an image and correction

(for the code file please refer: End_to_end_Auto_Image_tilt_angle_detection_and_correction.ipynb and input file: DemoImage.png)

### 3. Automatic cropping of white border in an image:
- Please refer these files: Crop_white_border_in_an_image.ipynb, whiteBorderImage.png, WhiteBorderTestSample2.png, WhiteBorderTestSample3.png, WhiteBorderTestSample4.png
