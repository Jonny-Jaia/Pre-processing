## Image-Processing
### 1. Image tilt or rotation by x angle 
- Using different techniques. For the explaination:

  (For the code Refer:"Tilt_or_rotate_an_image.ipynb" and DemoImage.png)
  
### 2. End to End automatic image tilt angle detection
- Exploration of Canny Edges and Hough linies detection
- demonstrated automatic tilt angle detection in an image and correction

(for the code file please refer: End_to_end_Auto_Image_tilt_angle_detection_and_correction.ipynb and input file: DemoImage.png)
